    NAME:
      wmom()
      
    PURPOSE:
      Calculate the weighted mean, error, and optionally standard deviation
      of an input array.

    CALLING SEQUENCE:
     wmean,werr = wmom(arr, weights, inputmean=None, calcerr=False, sdev=False)
    
    INPUTS:
      arr: A numpy array or a sequence that can be converted.
      weights: A set of weights for each elements in array.
    OPTIONAL INPUTS:
      inputmean: An input mean value, around which them mean is calculated.
      calcerr=False: Calculate the weighted error.  By default the error
        is calculated as 1/sqrt( weights.sum() ).  In this case it is
        calculated as sqrt( (w**2 * (arr-mean)**2).sum() )/weights.sum()
      sdev=False: If True, also return the weighted standard deviation 
        as a third element in the tuple.

    OUTPUTS:
      wmean, werr: A tuple of the weighted mean and error. If sdev=True the
         tuple will also contain sdev: wmean,werr,wsdev
